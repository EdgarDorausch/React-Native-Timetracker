# React Native Timetracker

This project aims to be a prototype to learn concepts of an NodeJS, ReactNative & Typescript ecosystem. Therefore I've chosen some basic (technological) features which I want to test/learn while programming the app. On top of this I made up some app features.

However this project focus on the learning process rather then a perfect result. So I try to document my learnings and hints as good as I can.

TIP: To open the UML files (*.mdj) you have to install link:http://staruml.io/[StarUML]

## Things I want to learn:

* Manifest & co.
** Loading Screen
** Icon
* Activity Management/Navigation
** (Redux integration)
** Tabs
** Stack
* Styling
** Colors etc.
** Animations
* Remote API
** Authentication <--> user-system
** (Bidirectional)
** Server <--> Tests
** Documentation
* Redux
* Phone API
** GPS
** Camera -> QR code
** Calendar export
** Push notification
* App-Tests

## The app should do:

* Login; (Register)
* Start & Stop time tracking for a Session
* List sessions
* Synchronize sessions; up- & download
* Reminder; sends push notification on a configured date/time; (export reminder to calendar)
* GPS tagging of sessions
* (Add friends; view if they are in a active session; real time/subscription; add friend via QR code)
* Tab-bar: timer, session-list, reminder-list, friend-list

## A list of useful Links

* Typescript integration of React Native: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/05/07/using-typescript-with-react-native
* A little explanation of the difference between Expo & CRNA: https://docs.expo.io/versions/v26.0.0/workflow/create-react-native-app
* Expo push notifications: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/push-notifications

## Hints

* Typescript is import via an transformer. Transformer can be included with the transformer property inside the packagerOpt object of the app.js file
